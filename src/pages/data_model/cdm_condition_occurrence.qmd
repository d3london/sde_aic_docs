### OMOP CDM 5.4 - OMOP.CONDITION_OCCURRENCE
This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient.

### IMPLEMENTATION - SILVER.CONDITION_OCCURRENCE

SILVER.CONDITION_OCCURRENCE is the cleaned and transformed version of ingested condition tables, that are used to stage vanilla OMOP CDM 5.4 tables (as well as other GOLD transformations). This table is wider than the OMOP data model, and includes the following differences:

- Includes an additional qualifier column to allow integration of 'diagnosis order' within NHS commissioning datasets;
- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- Source concept codes/names are surfaced to enable direct visibility over semantic provenance;
- Each row holds information about a single concept relative to a single person. We can therefore incorporate additional, NHS-specific, information about table and systems provenance relative to source data. By extension, this allows for additional understanding of context of data generation, whereas it is often necessary to infer 'OMOP condition status'.  
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are initialised, but set as null, and remain empty when carried into OMOP.
