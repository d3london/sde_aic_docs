## CONDITION_OCCURRENCE

### source.{source_table} (BRONZE)

Structured data sources for patient conditions or diagnoses will generally always include:

| Table                                  | Type            |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Commissioning Datasets                 | Legacy + Live          |
| Clinical Coding activity outputs | Legacy + Live          |
| Electronic health record system problem lists | Legacy + Live  |

Tables are loaded to the database in batches, or through incremental ingestion via connection to a source database.

### bronze.base_ or stg_{source}__{entity} (BRONZE)

Data sources are staged as `stg_{source}__{entity}` (if necessary, with an initial step of `base_{source}__{entity}` prior to unioning). This may include column renaming and edge case handling.

### silver.int_condition_occurrence (SILVER)

Different data sources are UNIONED into a minimum common dataset for representing the occurrence of conditions, and attached, relevant qualifiers. This table does not contain data from specialty systems such as cancer, which may have additional diagnostic qualifiers.

Diagnosis codes may be attached to a particular hospital admission or attendance. These `spells` or `attendances` must first be assigned a `visit_occurrence_id`, which is given to the relevant diagnosis in this intermediate stage.

```

### silver.mrt_condition_occurrence (SILVER)

This is the transformed version of ingested condition tables. This table is wider than the OMOP data model can be further constrained to transform into vanilla OMOP. It contains the following differences from OMOP:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are initialised, but we do not populate. They remain empty when carried into omop.condition_occurrence;

### omop.condition_occurrence (GOLD, OMOP CDM 5.4)

This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient. The canonical OMOP table is shown below.
