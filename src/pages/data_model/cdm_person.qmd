## PERSON

### OMOP CDM 5.4 - OMOP.PERSON
This table serves as the central identity management for all Persons in the OMOP data model. It contains records that uniquely identify each person or patient, and some demographic information.

### IMPLEMENTATION - SILVER.PERSON

SILVER.PERSON is the cleaned and transformed version of ingested person and demographic tables, that is used to stage vanilla OMOP CDM 5.4 tables (as well as other GOLD transformations). This table is wider than the OMOP data model, and includes the following differences:

- Surfaces both person_nhs_number and person_mrn (NHS hospital patients have two unique identifiers);
- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- Source concept codes/names are surfaced to enable direct visibility over semantic provenance;
- Additional demographic fields for deprivation are included; 
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are initialised, but set as null, and remain empty when carried into OMOP.PERSON.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

#### Person ID generation
While hospitals make effort to keep MRN numbers unique, it is possible that a single patient may have multiple MRNs. An option is to use NHS numbers, but these are not always available or compulsory in the record (e.g. patients from overseas may not have NHS numbers). As such person_id is based on MRN (see Person disambiguation).

#### Table and systems provenance
Fields in this table may be derived from different source tables. At present, we do not directly surface row or systems lineage within PERSON tables.

### OUTSTANDING ISSUES

#### Changes in person characteristics
Rows in OMOP.PERSON / SILVER.PERSON for a given person_id are not necessarily immutable, as demographic information may appear differently over different records (e.g. corrections, changes over time). When a demographic value is updated in a person's record, there should be a way to load into table and surface differences without destroying historical data (i.e. the ability to reproduce analyses must be preserved).

One possibility is to use validity flags and start/end dates to handle future changes to person details/demographics, either to correct for mistakes, or because demographic information has changed. This may necessiate using a valid start date column to create a composite PK. 

#### Person disambiguation
Prior to generating any new person_ids, there needs to be a process of disambiguation by checking against MRNs that are known to represent the same patient. To incorporate this into the model, it may be necessary to incorporate a person disambiguation table that enables a many-to-one mapping of person_ids.
