### source.{source_table} (BRONZE)

Structured data sources for person and core demographic information will generally always include:

| Table                                  | Type            |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Commissioning Datasets                 | Legacy          |
| Patient Information Management Systems | Legacy          |
| Electronic Health Record patient index | Live / ADT feed |
| Individual Observations / Facts        | Legacy + Live   |

Tables are loaded to the database in batches, or through incremental ingestion via connection to a source database. 

### bronze.base_ or stg_{source}__{entity} (BRONZE)

Data sources are staged as `stg_{source}__{entity}` (if necessary, with an initial step of `base_{source}__{entity}` prior to unioning). This may include column renaming and edge case handling.

### silver.int_person_identifier_lookup (SILVER)

Due to the large number of patient identification systems found in any hospital, and the possibility of patient ID duplication (and subsequent deduplication), we normalise all identifiers (including hospital IDs, NHS numbers, specific system IDs) under a `person_uuid` that we generate. Note that while NHS numbers are often seen as a canonical identifier, these exhibit significant missingness either due to failure to retrieve from NHS Spine, or because a patient is not registered in the NHS.

    int_person_identifier_lookup {
        person_uuid uuid "generated for each unique person"
        patient_id varchar "patient identifier from source systems"
        patient_id_type varchar "type of patient identifier"
        valid_from date "date of record creation"
        valid_to date "date of record deprecation (e.g. if lookup no longer valid)"
    }
```

### silver.int_person_birth, silver.int_person_gender, silver.int_person_ethnicity (SILVER)

The source tables which contain patient demographics are a combination of normalised tables, and flat / wide tables, and may be maintained as type 1 or 2 SCD. We normalise patient characteristics found in these tables to enable visibility over changing and/or conflicting information (data handling decisions are pushed to a later stage).

Normalised tables handle core characteristics, that we treat as patient dimensions.

### SILVER - silver.int_person_deprivation

Deprivation is derived from patient postcode. The remaining parts of address are discarded.

    }
```

### silver.mrt_person (SILVER)

This is the transformed version of ingested person and demographic tables. Concepts in this table are mapped to OMOP standards, and column naming is compatible, but it contains the following differences:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- Additional demographic fields for UK specific deprivation are included; 
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are excluded. When converting to vanilla OMOP, these columns remain empty. 
- To populate this, logic is applied to surface the most recent and reliable dimensions based on intermediate tables.

### omop.person (GOLD, OMOP CDM 5.4)
