## MEASUREMENT

### OMOP CDM 5.4 - OMOP.MEASUREMENT
The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurements, i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or Person's sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit (UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). The Procedure for obtaining the sample is housed in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table, though it is unnecessary to create a PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE record for each measurement if one does not exist in the source data. Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result. If there is no result, it is assumed that the lab test was conducted but the result was not captured.

### IMPLEMENTATION - SILVER.MEASUREMENT

SILVER.MEASUREMENT is the cleaned and transformed version of tables and flowsheets that record laboratory values, that are used to stage vanilla OMOP CDM 5.4 tables (as well as other GOLD transformations). This table is wider than the OMOP data model, and includes the following differences:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- Source concept codes/names are surfaced to enable direct visibility over semantic provenance;
- value_source_value is transformed and surfaced through operator_concept_name (direct visibility of any operators), value_as_number (OMOP - if clear numerical value), and value_as_categorical (for any string result, that does _not_ necessarily map to OMOP)
- Each row holds information about a single concept relative to a single person. We can therefore incorporate additional, NHS-specific, information about table and systems provenance relative to source data. By extension, this allows for additional understanding of context of data generation, whereas it is often necessary to infer 'OMOP measurement type'.
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are initialised, but set as null, and remain empty when carried into OMOP.
