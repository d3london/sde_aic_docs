## MEASUREMENT

### source.{source_table} (BRONZE)

Structured data sources for standardised clinical tests and measurements will generally always include:

| Table                                  | Type            |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Laboratory information systems              | Legacy + Live          |
| Vital signs recording systems | Legacy + Live          |
| Observation recording flowsheets | Legacy + Live          |

Tables are loaded to the database in batches, or through incremental ingestion via connection to a source database.

### bronze.base_ or stg_{source}__{entity} (BRONZE)

Data sources are staged as `stg_{source}__{entity}` (if necessary, with an initial step of `base_{source}__{entity}` prior to unioning). This may include column renaming and edge case handling.

### silver.int_measurement_laboratorytest (SILVER)

Different data sources are UNIONED into a common dataset for representing categorical or numerical results of laboratory tests or other tests on a patient sample.

Patients must first be assigned a `person_uuid`. Where dispensing is attached to a particular hospital admission or attendance, these `spells` or `attendances` must first be assigned a `visit_occurrence_id`.

```

### silver.int_measurement_clinicalob (SILVER)

Different data sources are UNIONED into a common dataset for representing categorical or numerical clinical observations such as vital signs or other quantitative findings based on a patient.

Patients must first be assigned a `person_uuid`. Where dispensing is attached to a particular hospital admission or attendance, these `spells` or `attendances` must first be assigned a `visit_occurrence_id`.

### silver.ext_measurement (SILVER)

This is the transformed version of ingested measurement tables. It includes results of tests on samples and measurements recorded directly for patients. Concepts in this table are mapped to OMOP standards, and column naming is compatible, but it contains the following differences:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are excluded. When converting to vanilla OMOP, these columns remain empty;
- Source, table, and systems provenance are maintained.
- Systems source is used to map to `measurement_type_concept_id` per OMOP.

### omop.measurement (GOLD, OMOP 5.4)

The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurements, i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or Person's sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit (UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result. If there is no result, it is assumed that the lab test was conducted but the result was not captured.
